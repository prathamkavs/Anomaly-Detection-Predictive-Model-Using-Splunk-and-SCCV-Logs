**Overview:** Implemented an anomaly detection model to forecast anomalies using Splunk and SCCV logs from MongoDB, employing Linear Regression for data analysis.

Steps and Tools:

1. **Data Collection:** Aggregated extensive log data from Splunk and SCCV stored in MongoDB.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the log data, handling missing values and normalizing the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Identified and engineered relevant features from the log data that could indicate anomalies.
4. **Model Selection:** Selected Linear Regression for its interpretability and simplicity in modeling relationships between variables.
5. **Training and Evaluation:** Trained the model on historical log data and validated its performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). Achieved a predictive accuracy of 88%.


**Impact:** The anomaly detection model enabled proactive identification of potential issues, allowing for timely intervention and reducing the impact of anomalies on system performance.
